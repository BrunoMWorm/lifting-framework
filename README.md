### Lifting Framework

TODO: description of the project and code structure.

The source code of the Variational Library is deeply inspired on method proposed in the paper [Automatic and efficient variability-aware lifting of functional programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3428225). The implementation also contains code extracted and modified from the [source repository](https://github.com/ramyshahin/ProductLineAnalysis) of the paper mentioned before.

You must have CUDD library installed. Instructions can be found [on this mirror](https://github.com/ivmai/cudd).
